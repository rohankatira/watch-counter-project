```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node package manager)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/watch-counter-project.git
   cd watch-counter-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application
To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

### Building for Production
To create a production build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
The production files will be generated in the `dist` directory.

## Usage
- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- You will see the counter displayed on the screen.
- Use the buttons to increment, decrement, or reset the counter.

## ESLint Configuration
The project uses ESLint for code linting. The configuration file is located at `eslint.config.js`. It includes rules for JavaScript and React, ensuring code quality and consistency.

### Example ESLint Configuration
```javascript
import js from '@eslint/js';
import globals from 'globals';
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';
import reactRefresh from 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh';

export default [
  { ignores: ['dist'] },
  {
    files: ['**/*.{js,jsx}'],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      globals: globals.browser,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: 'latest',
        ecmaFeatures: { jsx: true },
        sourceType: 'module',
      },
    },
    plugins: {
      'react-hooks': reactHooks,
      'react-refresh': reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...js.configs.recommended.rules,
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      'no-unused-vars': ['error', { varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]' }],
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
        'warn',
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
    },
  },
];
```

## Conclusion
The Watch Counter Project is a simple yet effective demonstration of using React with Vite for building modern web applications. Follow the setup instructions to get started, and feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
